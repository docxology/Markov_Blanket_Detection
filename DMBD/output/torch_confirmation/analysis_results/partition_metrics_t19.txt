Analysis of PyTorch-Inferred Markov Blanket Partition (Time=19)
=========================================================

Cell Counts:
  Internal states: 0
  Blanket states: 0
  External states: 218
  Total cells: 400

Density Counts:
  High density cells (>70%): 4
  Medium density cells (30-70%): 12
  Low density cells (<30%): 384

Overlap Metrics:
  Internal states:
    High density: 0 (nan% of internal)
    Medium density: 0 (nan% of internal)
    Low density: 0 (nan% of internal)
  Blanket states:
    High density: 0 (nan% of blanket)
    Medium density: 0 (nan% of blanket)
    Low density: 0 (nan% of blanket)
  External states:
    High density: 0 (0.00% of external)
    Medium density: 0 (0.00% of external)
    Low density: 218 (100.00% of external)

Precision and Recall for Internal States vs High Density:
  Recall: 0.00% of high-density cells are classified as internal
  Precision: 0.00% of cells classified as internal are high-density
  F1 Score: nan% if both > 0 else 0
