Metrics for PyTorch-Inferred Markov Blanket Partition (Time=15)
==========================================================

Cell Counts:
  Internal states: 21 cells
  Blanket states: 55 cells
  External states: 324 cells
  Total cells: 400 cells

Density Analysis:
  High density cells (>70% max): 9 cells
  Internal states that are high density: 9 cells

Precision and Recall:
  Recall: 100.00% of high density cells are classified as internal
  Precision: 42.86% of internal cells are high density
  F1 Score: 60.00%

Topological Constraints:
  Internal states form a connected component: True
  Internal states are surrounded by blanket: True
